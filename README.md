## A place where one-off ideas/partial projects can live comfortably

Howdy world, I plan to use this repo as a dump for all my ideas and projects that I've worked on but haven't finished, or those I've abandoned but think are worth keeping around. 

Projects will most likely be structured as a list and organized by category, where the items in the list are links to pages that describe individual projects, with additional links to resources/media if necessary.
