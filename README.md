## A place where one-off ideas/partial projects can live comfortably

Howdy world, I plan to use this repo as a dump for all my ideas and projects that I've worked on but haven't finished, or those I've abandoned but are worth keeping around. 

Projects will most likely be structured as a list and organized by category, where the items in the list are links to pages that describe individual projects, with additional links to resources/media if necessary.
