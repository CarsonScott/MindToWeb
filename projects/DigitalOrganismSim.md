# Digital Organism Evolution Simulation

### Overview

This article describes an evolutionary simulation of digital organisms that exist in a spatiotemporal environment and perform biological behaviors such as consumption and reproduction. Energy exists in various forms in the simulation and can be converted from one to another according to physical rules of the environment. The flow and conversion of energy drives the evolution of the system over time.
Energy comes in the form of light, heat, matter, and force. The law of conservation is partially obeyed in the sense that energy is not created or destroyed by events in the simulation, however energy is introduced to the system externally in the form of heat and light. 

### Life and Death

Organisms are made up of matter and consume energy from the environment to sustain life. Stored energy is an abstract representation of energy that does not exist in any particular form, and describes the amount of energy that has been consumed and is available at any given time. In other words, it is the potential energy that may be expelled in one form or another by an organism.

Death can occur when an organism runs out of stored energy, in which case it seizes to function and can no longer dynamically process energy. What’s left is the matter from which the organism is made, which remains in the environment for consumption.

Death can also occur when experiencing excessive amounts of energy, either through environmental factors like extreme heat in a particular area or the actions of other organisms. Predation is one example of this phenomenon in which an organism kills another via expulsion of energy for the specific purpose of consumption. 

### Mind and Body

An organism consists of a “body”, i.e. a collection of physical components that interface directly with the environment, and a “mind”, i.e. a cognitive structure that interfaces with sensors and motors of the body. The layout of both are dictated by the organism’s genome, which is passed down from parent to offspring during reproduction and is correlated with species.

The body of an organism is a system of physical components with various functions that are spatially connected. A body segment is a component that is purely structural, which is to say that it has no functionality, in contrast to sensors, motors, and absorbers. Sensors and motors are responsible for detecting and expelling specific forms of energy respectively, and absorbers take in specific forms of energy to be stored.

The mind of an organism is a network of nodes that send signals between one another. With the exception of input nodes corresponding to sensors and output nodes corresponding to motors, all nodes are uniform in functionality. The topology of the network is based on the topology of the body in terms of distance between physical components. The overall function of the mind is to monitor and control the body.

### Reproduction and Evolution

Reproduction occurs when an organism has a sufficient surplus of stored energy, and results in the creation of a new organism based on a mutated copy of the original organism’s genome. In other words, the original organism is duplicated with a random chance of alterations in structure.

Mutations can impact “performance”, i.e. the efficient processing of energy, and those with mutations that increase performance are likely to have higher reproductive success (reproduction being the result of surplus energy). 

The obvious conclusion is that genomes with such mutations are likely to be expressed more prominently in the population than those without, and since energy is a limited resource, weaker species of organisms become less likely to obtain energy before their competition. This can lead to repeated starvation/death of the lesser organisms and eventually extinction of entire lineages. This is the process responsible for the continuous innovation and optimization of the digital ecosystem.
